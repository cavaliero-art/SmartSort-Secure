**SmartSort Secure**
is a full-stack web application designed to revolutionize waste management in Tunisia by creating a transparent, engaging, and profitable circular economy. This project combines AI-powered waste identification, a gamified citizen rewards platform, and a Hedera-backed backend to ensure every recycling action is verifiable and valuable.
---
It was built as a comprehensive solution to real-world environmental and economic challenges, providing distinct portals for citizens, corporate partners, and municipal administrators.
---
**🌟 Project Overview**
At its core, SmartSort Secure tackles the problem of inefficient and untrustworthy recycling systems. By integrating cutting-edge technology, we've created an ecosystem where:

👥 Citizens are empowered and incentivized to recycle correctly.

🏢 Corporations can verifiably meet their ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals.

🏛️ Municipalities gain powerful tools to manage city services efficiently and generate new revenue streams.

Our latest feature, the "Is It Recyclable? AI Check", provides immediate value to users by allowing them to upload a photo of any item and get an instant, AI-powered verdict on its recyclability, removing the guesswork from their daily lives.
